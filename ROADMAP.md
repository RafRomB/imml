Project roadmap
=================

Our vision is to establish *iMML* as a leading and reliable library for multi-modal learning across research and
applied settings. This roadmap outlines our priorities to broaden algorithmic coverage, improve performance and
scalability, strengthen interoperability, and grow a healthy contributor community.

Guiding principles
------------------
- Practical first: prioritize features that unlock common multi‑modal workflows.
- Consistent API: keep estimators, transformers, and pipelines aligned with the ``scikit‑learn`` and
  ``Lightning`` (for deep learning) interfaces.
- Reproducible and well‑tested: maintain strong test coverage, deterministic options, and reproducible examples.
- Interoperable by design: accept standard array‑likes (NumPy, pandas), and offer bridges to popular ecosystems.

Thematic tracks
---------------
#### Expanding the multi-modal learning field
- Although *iMML* originated with a focus on incomplete multi-modal data, most methods can also be applied to fully
  observed datasets. To broaden adoption and diversity, we will encourage contributions of new multi-modal
  algorithms, even if they do not explicitly handle missing data.

#### Algorithm diversity
- Extend the set of supervised learners that operate on incomplete data natively.
- Add modules for new tasks: regression, time‑series forecasting/classification, etc.
- Support additional modality types, such as audio, video and graphs, with new algorithms, utility helpers
  and examples.

#### Performance and scalability
- Re-implement wrapped algorithms in native Python where feasible, simplifying dependencies and improving
  maintainability.
- Optimize common operations for speed and memory efficiency.

#### Interoperability and compatibility
- Provide support for `polars` for users who prefer that backend.
- Maintain backward compatibility and versioned APIs to minimize user disruption.

#### Documentation, tutorials, and examples
- Publish new end-to-end tutorials that cover diverse data workflows and highlight the capabilities of *iMML*.
- Develop troubleshooting guides for common pitfalls in multi-modal learning and how to diagnose them.

#### Community and governance
- Encourage contributions via clear guidelines and well-scoped tasks.
- Use GitHub Discussions and Issues for proposals; adopt an issue template for substantial changes.
- Recognize and celebrate contributors in release notes, documentation, and community channels.
