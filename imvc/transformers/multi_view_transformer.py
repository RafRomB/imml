class MultiViewTransformer(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    r"""
    A transformer that applies the same transformation to multiple views of data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    transformer : scikit-learn transformer object or list of scikit-learn transformer object
        A scikit-learn transformer object that will be used to transform each view of data. If a list is provided,
        each transformer will be applied on each view, otherwise the same transformer will be applied on each view.

    Attributes
    ----------
    transformer_list_ : list of transformers (n_views,)
        A list of transformers, one for each view of data.
    same_transformer_ : boolean
        A booleaing indicating if the same transformer will be applied on each view of data.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from imvc.datasets import load_incomplete_nutrimouse
    >>> from imvc.transformers import MultiViewTransformer
    >>> from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
    >>> Xs = load_incomplete_nutrimouse(p = [0.2, 0.5])
    >>> mv_transformer = MultiViewTransformer(transformer = SimpleImputer.set_output(transform = 'pandas'))
    >>> mv_transformer.fit_transform(Xs)
