class NEMO(BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin):

    NEMO (NEighborhood based Multi-Omics clustering).

    NEMO is a method used for clustering data from multiple views sources. This algorithm operates
    through three main stages. Initially, it constructs a similarity matrix for each modality that represents the
    similarities between different samples. Then, it merges these individual view matrices into a unified one,
    combining the information from all views. Finally, the algorithm performs the actual clustering process on this
    integrated network, grouping similar samples together based on their multi-views data patterns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_clusters : int or list-of-int
        The number of clusters to generate. If it is a list, the number of clusters will be estimated by the algorithm
         with this range of number of clusters to choose between.
    num_neighbors : list or int, default=None
        The number of neighbors to use for each view. It can either be a number, a list of numbers or None. If it is a
        number, this is the number of neighbors used for all views. If this is a list, the number of neighbors are
        taken for each view from that list. If it is None, each view chooses the number of neighbors to be the number
        of samples divided by num_neighbors_ratio.
    num_neighbors_ratio : int, default=6
        The number of clusters to generate. If it is not provided, it will be estimated by the algorithm.
    metric : str or list-of-str, default="sqeuclidean"
        Distance metric to compute. Must be one of available metrics in :py:func`scipy.spatial.distance.pdist`. If
        multiple arrays a provided an equal number of metrics may be supplied.
    random_state : int, default=None
        Determines the randomness. Use an int to make the randomness deterministic.
.    verbose : bool, default=False
        Verbosity mode.

    Attributes
    ----------
    labels_ : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Predicted modules in training data.
    n_clusters_ : int
        Final number of clusters.
    num_neighbors_ : int
        Final number of neighbors.
