    @staticmethod
    def load_incomplete_digits(p, return_y: bool = False, shuffle: bool = True, random_state: int = None):
        r"""
        Load the UCI multiple features dataset, taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
        at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Multiple+Features. This data set consists of 6 views of
        handwritten digit images, with classes 0-9..

        Parameters
        ----------
        p: list or int
            The percentaje that each view will have for missing samples. If p is int, all the views will have the
            same percentaje.
        return_y: bool, default False
            If True, return the label too.
        shuffle: bool, default False
            If True, shuffle the dataset.
        random_state: int, default None
            If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator.

        Returns
        -------
        Xs : list of array-likes
            - Xs length: n_views
            - Xs[i] shape: (n_samples_i, n_features_i)
            A list of different views.
        y : optional
            Array with labels

        Notes
        -----
        This data consists of six views:
        - 6 Fourier coefficients of the character shapes
        - 216 profile correlations
        - 64 Karhunen-Love coefficients
        - 240 pixel averages of the images from 2x3 windows
        - 47 Zernike moments
        - 6 morphological features
