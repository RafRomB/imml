Tutorials
====================

This folder collects hands‑on, runnable examples that demonstrate how to use `iMML` for common multi‑modal learning
workflows, including exploring datasets, simulating missing modalities, and clustering with incomplete data,
among others. Each script is self‑contained and designed to be easy to adapt to your own data.
You can find the tutorials in:

- Online documentation: https://imml.readthedocs.io/stable/auto_tutorials/index.html.
  The online gallery renders these scripts as rich, formatted pages with figures.
- In-repo: https://github.com/ocbe-uio/imml/tree/main/tutorials. As Python scripts, run any file directly. Most scripts will print intermediate results and pop up figures.
